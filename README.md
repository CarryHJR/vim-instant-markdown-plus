vim-instant-markdown
====================

Want to instantly preview finicky markdown files, but don't want to leave your
favourite editor, or have to do it in some crappy browser text area?
**vim-instant-markdown** is your friend! When you open a markdown file in vim,
a browser window will open which shows the compiled markdown in real-time, and
closes once you close the file in vim.

As a bonus, [github-flavored-markdown][gfm] is supported, and styles used while
previewing are the same as those GitHub uses!

Installation
------------
**Quick start** (assuming you have all the necessary dependencies):

- Install the mini-server by running either:

  - `[sudo] npm -g install instant-markdown-d` or, for the pre-release version:
  - `[sudo] npm -g install instant-markdown-d@next`

  alternatively:

  - `pip install --user smdv`

  for the Python mini-server.

* Add the following to your `.vimrc`, depending on the plugin manager of your
  choice:

  - [vim-plug][plug]

    ```vim
    Plug 'suan/vim-instant-markdown', {'for': 'markdown'}
    ```

  - [Vundle][vundle]

    ```vim
    Plugin 'suan/vim-instant-markdown', {'rtp': 'after'}
    ```

- Minimal default configuration:

    ```vim
    filetype plugin on
    "Uncomment to override defaults:
    "let g:instant_markdown_slow = 1
    "let g:instant_markdown_autostart = 0
    "let g:instant_markdown_open_to_the_world = 1
    "let g:instant_markdown_allow_unsafe_content = 1
    "let g:instant_markdown_allow_external_content = 0
    "let g:instant_markdown_mathjax = 1
    "let g:instant_markdown_logfile = '/tmp/instant_markdown.log'
    "let g:instant_markdown_autoscroll = 0
    "let g:instant_markdown_port = 8888
    "let g:instant_markdown_python = 1
    ```

**Detailed instructions**

- If you're on Linux, ensure the following packages are installed:
  - `xdg-utils`
  - `curl`
  - `nodejs`
- If you're on Windows, you will need into install [cURL][curl] and put it on your `%PATH%`.
- If you do not use a plugin manager, copy the
  [`after/ftplugin/markdown/instant-markdown.vim`](after/ftplugin/markdown/instant-markdown.vim)
  file into `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/markdown/` (creating directories as
  necessary),
- Open a markdown file in vim and enjoy!

Configuration
-------------
### g:instant_markdown_slow

By default, vim-instant-markdown will update the display in realtime.  If that taxes your system too much, you can specify

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_slow = 1
```

before loading the plugin (for example place that in your `~/.vimrc`). This will cause vim-instant-markdown to only refresh on the following events:

- No keys have been pressed for a while
- A while after you leave insert mode
- You save the file being edited

### g:instant_markdown_autostart
By default, vim-instant-markdown will automatically launch the preview window when you open a markdown file. If you want to manually control this behavior, you can specify

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_autostart = 0
```

in your .vimrc. You can always manually trigger preview via the command
`:InstantMarkdownPreview` and stop it via `:InstantMarkdownStop`.

### g:instant_markdown_open_to_the_world
By default, the server only listens on localhost. To make the server available to others in your network, edit your .vimrc and add

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_open_to_the_world = 1
```

Only use this setting on trusted networks!

### g:instant_markdown_allow_unsafe_content
By default, scripts are blocked. To allow scripts to run, edit your .vimrc and add

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_allow_unsafe_content = 1
```

### g:instant_markdown_allow_external_content
By default, external resources such as images, stylesheets, frames and plugins are allowed.
To block such content, edit your .vimrc and add

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_allow_external_content = 0
```

### g:instant_markdown_logfile
For troubleshooting, server startup and curl communication from Vim to the server can be logged into a file.

```
let g:instant_markdown_logfile = '/tmp/instant_markdown.log'
```

### g:instant_markdown_mathjax
By default, no TeX code embedded within markdown would be rendered. This option
uses MathJax and launches the node server as `instant-markdown-d --mathjax`.

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_mathjax = 1
```

New in version `instant-markdown-d==0.2.0`

### g:instant_markdown_browser
By default, browser is detected by `instant-markdown-d` depending on the OS.
Starting with version `instant-markdown-d>=0.2.0`, you can set something like

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_browser = "firefox --new-window"
```

New in version `instant-markdown-d==0.2.0`

### g:instant_markdown_port
Choose a custom port instead of the default `8090`.

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_port = 8888
```

New in version `instant-markdown-d==0.2.0`

### g:instant_markdown_autoscroll
By default, with version `instant-markdown-d>=0.2.0`, the live preview
auto-scrolls to where your cursor is positioned.  To disable this behaviour,
edit your .vimrc and add

```vim
let g:instant_markdown_autoscroll = 0
```

New in version `instant-markdown-d==0.2.0`

Supported Platforms
-------------------
OSX, Unix/Linuxes*, and Windows**.

<sub>*: One annoyance in Linux is that there's no way to reliably open a browser page in the background, so you'll likely have to manually refocus your vim session everytime you open a Markdown file. If you have ideas on how to address this I'd love to know!</sub>

<sub>**: In Windows, there's no easy way to execute commands asynchronously without popping up a cmd.exe window. Thus, if you run this plugin without `g:instant_markdown_slow`, you might experience performance issues.</sub>

FAQ
---
> It's not working!

- Make sure `instant-markdown-d` was installed as a global module (e.g. using `npm -g install`)
- If you're on OSX and are using zsh, try to add `set shell=bash\ -i` in your `.vimrc` to set interactive bash as the default vim shell. (See [this issue](http://github.com/suan/vim-instant-markdown/issues/41))

> Why don't my `<bla>.md` files trigger this plugin?

By default, vim versions before 7.4.480 only recognize files ending with `.markdown`, `.mdown`, and `README.md` as markdown files. If you want `<anything>.md` to be recognized, I recommend installing one of many markdown plugins available, such as [this one][tpope-markdown].

_If you're curious, the code for the mini-server component for this plugin can
be found at http://github.com/suan/instant-markdown-d. A plugin can easily be
written for any editor to interface with the server to get the same
functionality found here._
